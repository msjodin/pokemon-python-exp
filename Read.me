Just started learning python3. 
Made this game with the help of two additional learners to help test our knowledge of the basic concepts and coding within python. 
I know eval() generally shouldn't be applied to user input because it has a capacity to perform malicious actions, 
but this is just a prototype. Open to suggestions to improve the game.
